    Introduction

‚õ∫Introducing Camp
What is Camp Network?

Camp Network is a purpose-built Layer-1 blockchain for powering AI agents trained on provenance-backed, user-owned IP. 

Camp's Autonomous IP Layer enables anyone to tokenize IP ‚Äî music, images, videos, even personal data ‚Äî and register it onchain for AI training, remixing, and monetization.

Its architecture prioritizes gasless IP registration and royalty distribution, and supports isolated execution environments tailored for agent-based workflows and automated licensing. Developers can launch dedicated app chains with isolated blockspace and compute, offering the flexibility and scalability needed for high-performance workloads.

Why does Camp Exist?

AI is rapidly reshaping the internet, and it poses an existential risk to all creators. As models continue to be trained on content taken without consent or attribution, creators are losing visibility, control, and compensation. 

Fueling this problem is the accelerating shift toward autonomous AI agents: systems users will increasingly rely on to filter information, make decisions, and interact with the digital world. As general-purpose models become commoditized, real value will shift to both unique, user-owned IP and vertical agents fine-tuned on that IP.

That‚Äôs where Camp comes in. Camp treats IP as a first-class primitive ‚Äî not an afterthought. This is the first step towards building a future where AI and IP can collaborate.

Transforming Creative Work into a New Economic Layer

Camp starts with a core belief: provenance isn‚Äôt just about protecting IP ‚Äî it‚Äôs the necessary foundation for making ownership and value enforceable by design.

Camp‚Äôs Proof of Provenance (PoP) Protocol is a novel mechanism for registering IP onchain with traceable origin, usage rights, and attribution, while enabling derivative creation, licensing, and monetization. Paired with Camp‚Äôs native agent framework, it allows users to fine-tune and deploy AI agents directly on user owned IP. This makes provenance actionable and verifiable ‚Äî enabling agents to interact with data transparently, and automating monetization back to contributors.

But What Makes Camp Different Isn‚Äôt Just the Tech ‚Äî It‚Äôs the Focus

Camp is built for apps that onboard IP at scale ‚Äî enabling users, creators, and AI agents to register, remix, and monetize content in an AI-native, onchain economy. Camp uses provenance to register user-owned IP onchain through its Origin Framework, turning IP into programmable, monetizable infrastructure from day one.

Once IP is registered onchain:

    Contributors define terms, remix rights, and royalty splits

    Consumers and agents license IP for reuse, training, or AI generation

    All activity is transparently tracked ‚Äî fueling better attribution and discovery

By embedding IP ownership and value flows at the protocol level, Camp helps all contributors better monetize their work ‚Äî building a more composable, equitable, and creator-aligned digital economy.

    Introduction

üçéHow Camp Works

A Quick Guide
Camp User Flow
Building the Future of AI and IP

Camp is a purpose built blockchain for training and fine-tuning AI agents on decentralized, user-owned IP.

With Origin, users can register any type of IP ‚Äî art, code, music, and more‚Äîdirectly into . Once registered, their IP becomes immediately discoverable and available for others to license, remix, or build upon.

mAItrix allows you to deploy AI agents that can train on user-owned IP. Unlocking agents to generate derivative IP and tailored workflows, learning from user interactions all onchain which ensures transparent attribution and compliant use while unlocking new possibilities for applications and creator economy.

Royalties are handled natively. Every interaction with registered IP ‚Äî including reuse, remixing, or AI generation ‚Äî automatically distributes payouts to original contributors. This creates a built-in incentive layer that rewards collaboration across AI-native applications as well.

ABC Stack

A brief description of our L1 stack

The ABC Stack is a high-performance sovereign rollup framework that leverages Celestia‚Äôs Data Availability layer. By decoupling bridge functionality from the execution layer and relying on Celestia for data availability, it eliminates the limitations of traditional rollup solutions and allows anyone to download and verify the state of the Camp network using Data availability sampling. 

Operating as its own settlement layer, ABC Stack avoids the overhead of an enshrined Ethereum bridge, enabling modular bridging tailored to application needs while maintaining a focus on optimized execution.

    Throughput reaches up to approximately 1 Gigagas/s, which is the upper range of performance and 100x higher than competing stacks.

    Transactions Per Second (TPS): 50,000 

    Block Times: Recommended value of 250ms, with a lower bound of 100ms (ongoing improvements targeting sub-100ms)

    EVM Compatibility: 100% Ethereum Virtual Machine identical, supporting all the latest opcodes. 

    Data Availability (DA) Options:

        Celestia: Public, decentralized DA

    ZK-Ready: Future-proofed for zero-knowledge supporting zkVMs & using the EIP-4844 opcodes for verifying KZG commitments. That is, given a blob commitment and a zero knowledge proof, the precompile reverts if the proof is invalid.

Origin Framework

Some features are still in active development

The Origin framework streamlines registering and managing IP onchain, enabling agents to mint and monetize new IP. Users can define custom parameters on how their IP can and should be used onchain, to which all the actors adhere to for any tasks ie, remixing, consumption, attribution. 
IP registration user flow
Key features of the Origin framework include:

    Effortless IP Management: Simplifies the onboarding of user-owned IP and agents, while allowing users to remix existing IP with ease.

    IP Monetization: Interactions between IP and agents (virtual or real) form an economic system of royalty & value flow, which camp powers seamlessly. 

    Tokenomics Support: Implements granular IP ownership and revenue share between ecosystem players fostering better alignment. 

    User-Friendly Onboarding: Abstracts complex onchain processes, enabling seamless participation for non-technical users.

    Origin V1

‚öôÔ∏èOrigin Framework

What is the Origin Framework?
Welcome to Origin
Overview

The Origin platform is designed to onboard and manage intellectual property (IP) within Camp‚Äôs registry. It comprises two main components: the Origin APIs and the Origin Smart Contracts, which form the core of the system.

The Origin Smart Contracts consist of three major modules:

    IpNFT

    Marketplace

    Dispute Module

The Origin APIs are a suite of tools and resources that enable developers to integrate with and interact with the Origin platform. They provide a simple, consistent interface for accessing platform data and functionality, and support a wide range of authentication methods (including OAuth). Additionally, the APIs facilitate access to data from various third-party platforms‚Äîsuch as Spotify, Twitter, TikTok, and others‚Äîallowing developers to incorporate these services into their applications and leverage user data effectively within Camp‚Äôs registry.

    Origin V1

üí°Getting Started

This is how to get started
üß© Integrating Origin SDK into a React App to Create IP NFTs

Everything you need to go from an empty React project to a fully-featured IP-NFT minter.
Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

    Node ‚â• 18 with npm or yarn

    A React 18 project (Vite, CRA, Next.js, etc.)

    Wallet integration (e.g. MetaMask or WalletConnect; Para SDK is optional)

    An Origin developer account to obtain your Client ID

    Environment variables:

    # .env
    VITE_ORIGIN_API=<YOUR-ORIGIN-API-URL>
    VITE_ORIGIN_CLIENT_ID=<YOUR-CAMP-CLIENT-ID>
    VITE_SUBGRAPH_URL=<YOUR-SUBGRAPH-URL>

        ‚ö†Ô∏è Replace these with actual values from your project. The provided URLs (e.g. api.origin.campnetwork.xyz) are placeholders.

    A small amount of $CAMP on the supported testnet (‚â• 0.01) for gas

Installation

Install the core SDK and utilities:

# Origin SDK core + React hooks (already bundled)
npm i @campnetwork/origin viem

# Optional: Utilities used in this guide
npm i @tanstack/react-query @apollo/client graphql

    üí° @campnetwork/origin/react is already included in the main SDK, no need to install it separately.

Bootstrapping Providers

Set up your providers in src/main.tsx. Only CampProvider is required ‚Äî others (Apollo, React Query, etc.) are optional based on your setup.

import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { CampProvider } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, ApolloProvider } from "@apollo/client";
import App from "./App";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();
const apollo = new ApolloClient({
  uri: import.meta.env.VITE_SUBGRAPH_URL,
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <CampProvider clientId={import.meta.env.VITE_ORIGIN_CLIENT_ID}>
        <ApolloProvider client={apollo}>
          <App />
        </ApolloProvider>
      </CampProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </StrictMode>
);

    üõë This example omits Para SDK for simplicity. Origin SDK already supports all EVM wallets and WalletConnect out of the box. Para is only needed if you're embedding wallets via OAuth.

Authenticating Users with Origin

Add the CampModal component anywhere in your app. It renders the authentication modal at the root and automatically injects a button where you place it.

import { CampModal } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";

export default function Auth() {
  return <CampModal />;
}

    ‚ö†Ô∏è If you‚Äôre using both Para and Origin in the same app, you can rename the useModal hook (e.g. useCampModal) to avoid naming collisions. For most apps, you can skip custom hooks and let the built-in modal handle everything.

To access authentication state and wallet-connected utilities:

const { jwt, origin, viem } = useAuth();
// jwt: Bearer token for API requests
// origin: SDK instance for minting/transferring NFTs
// viem: EIP-1193 provider

Calling the Origin API (Off-Chain)

Here are some examples of calling Origin‚Äôs REST API using the JWT token.
Generate AI Remix Images

export async function generateImage(model: "bear" | "fox" | "goat", jwt: string) {
  const res = await fetch(`${import.meta.env.VITE_ORIGIN_API}/auth/merv/generate-image`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${jwt}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ model_type: model }),
  });
  const { data } = await res.json();
  return data.images as { id: string; url: string }[];
}

Check Generation Credits

export async function getCredits(jwt: string) {
  const res = await fetch(`${import.meta.env.VITE_ORIGIN_API}/auth/merv/check-generations`, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${jwt}` },
  });
  const { data } = await res.json();
  return data.generations_left as number;
}

Assign Image After Mint

export async function assignImage(imageId: string, jwt: string) {
  await fetch(`${import.meta.env.VITE_ORIGIN_API}/auth/merv/assign-image`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${jwt}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ image_id: imageId }),
  });
}

Minting an IP-NFT

Here‚Äôs how to mint an NFT and assign a generated image:

import { useAuth } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";
import { assignImage } from "../utils/assignImage";

export default function MintButton({ file, imageId, meta }) {
  const { origin, jwt } = useAuth();

  const handleMint = async () => {
    if (!origin || !jwt) throw new Error("User not authenticated");

    const licence = {
      price: 0n,
      duration: 0n,
      royaltyBps: 0,
      paymentToken: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    } as const;

    const parentId = 4n; // optional: define if this is a derivative
    await origin.mintFile(file, meta, licence, parentId);
    await assignImage(imageId, jwt);
  };

  return <button onClick={handleMint}>Mint NFT</button>;
}

What mintFile() Does:

    Uploads your file and metadata to IPFS/Filecoin

    Calls the IP-NFT smart contract‚Äôs mint function

    Writes the licensing terms on-chain

Optional: Para SDK Integration

If you want embedded wallets or OAuth flows, you can integrate Para by:

    Calling generateProvider() to create a custom wallet provider

    Passing that provider to CampModal via the provider prop

For the sake of simplicity, this guide focuses on wallet-agnostic integration using Origin SDK only.

        discord - The URI to redirect to after the user completes oauth for Discord.

        spotify - The URI to redirect to after the user completes oauth for Spotify.

    allowAnalytics - Whether to allow analytics to be collected. Defaults to true.

You may use the redirectUri object to redirect the user to different pages based on the social they are linking. You may only define the URIs for the socials you are using, the rest will default to window.location.href.

import { Auth } from "@campnetwork/origin";

const auth = new Auth({
  clientId: string,
  redirectUri: string | object,
  allowAnalytics: boolean,
});

const auth = new Auth({
  clientId: "your-client-id",
  redirectUri: {
    twitter: "https://your-website.com/twitter",
    discord: "https://your-website.com/discord",
    spotify: "https://your-website.com/spotify",
  },
});

Methods

connect

connect() => void

The connect method prompts the user to sign a message with their wallet in order to authenticate with the Origin SDK. The wallet provider can be set by calling the setProvider method on the Auth instance beforehand. The default provider used is window.ethereum.

auth.connect();

disconnect

disconnect() => void

The disconnect method logs the user out of the Origin SDK on the client side.

auth.disconnect();

setProvider

setProvider(provider: { provider: EIP1193Provider, info: EIP6963ProviderInfo }) => void

Read more about the EIP1193Provider and EIP6963ProviderInfo interfaces.

The setProvider method sets the wallet provider to be used for authentication.

auth.setProvider({
  provider: window.ethereum,
  info: { name: "MetaMask", icon: "https://..." },
});

setWalletAddress

setWalletAddress(walletAddress: string) => void

The setWalletAddress method sets the wallet address to be used for authentication (via the connect method).

This is only needed if the provider does not support the eth_requestAccounts method. Only use this method if you are sure you need to set the wallet address manually.

auth.setWalletAddress("0x1234567890");

on

on(event: string, callback: (data: any) => void) => void

The on method listens for events emitted by the Auth module of the Origin SDK.

The following events are emitted:

"state"

Possible states:

    authenticated - The user has successfully authenticated.

    unauthenticated - The user has been logged out.

    loading - The user is in the process of authenticating.

auth.on("state", (data) => {
  console.log(data); // "authenticated" | "unauthenticated" | "loading"
});

"provider"

Returns the provider that has been set via the setProvider method. If using the Origin SDK React components, this event is emitted when the user selects a provider in the Auth modal.

auth.on("provider", (data) => {
  console.log(data); // { provider: EIP1193Provider, info: EIP6963ProviderInfo }
});

"providers"

Returns the list of providers that have been injected via EIP6963 and that the user can select from.

auth.on("providers", (data) => {
  console.log(data); // [{ provider: EIP1193Provider, info: EIP6963ProviderInfo }]
});

You may use this event to update the UI with the available providers. The user can then select a provider to authenticate with, and the setProvider method can be called with the selected provider. The connect method can then be called to authenticate the user.

auth.on("providers", (data) => {
  // Update UI with providers
  // User selects a provider
  const selectedProvider = data[0];

  auth.setProvider(selectedProvider);

  auth.connect();
});

getLinkedSocials

getLinkedSocials() => Promise<{ twitter: boolean, discord: boolean, spotify: boolean }>

The getLinkedSocials method returns a promise that resolves to an object containing the possible socials that the user can link and whether they are linked or not.

const linkedSocials = await auth.getLinkedSocials();

console.log(linkedSocials); // { twitter: true, discord: false, spotify: true }

After the user has authenticated, the following methods can be used to link and unlink social accounts. When linking a social account, the user will be redirected to the OAuth flow for that social platform. Afterwards, the user will be redirected back to the redirectUri specified in the Auth constructor.

linkTwitter

linkTwitter() => void

The linkTwitter method redirects the user to the Twitter OAuth flow to link their Twitter account to the Auth Hub.

auth.linkTwitter();

linkDiscord

linkDiscord() => void

The linkDiscord method redirects the user to the Discord OAuth flow to link their Discord account to the Auth Hub.

auth.linkDiscord();

linkSpotify

linkSpotify() => void

The linkSpotify method redirects the user to the Spotify OAuth flow to link their Spotify account to the Auth Hub.

auth.linkSpotify();

linkTikTok

linkTikTok(handle: string) => Promise<void>

The linkTikTok method links the provided TikTok handle to the Auth Hub.

auth.linkTikTok("tiktokhandle");

sendTelegramOTP

sendTelegramOTP(phoneNumber: string) => Promise<void> The sendTelegramOTP method sends an OTP to the provided phone number via Telegram. The OTP can be used via the linkTelegram method to link the user's Telegram account to the Auth Hub.

const { phone_code_hash } = await auth.sendTelegramOTP("+1234567890");

linkTelegram

linkTelegram(phoneNumber: string, otp: string, phoneCodeHash: string) => Promise<void>

The linkTelegram method links the provided phone number to the Auth Hub using the OTP and phone code hash received from the sendTelegramOTP method.

await auth.linkTelegram("+1234567890", "123456", "abc123");

unlinkTwitter

unlinkTwitter() => Promise<void>

The unlinkTwitter method unlinks the user's Twitter account from the Auth Hub.

await auth.unlinkTwitter();

unlinkDiscord

unlinkDiscord() => Promise<void>

The unlinkDiscord method unlinks the user's Discord account from the Auth Hub.

await auth.unlinkDiscord();

unlinkSpotify

unlinkSpotify() => Promise<void>

The unlinkSpotify method unlinks the user's Spotify account from the Auth Hub.

await auth.unlinkSpotify();

unlinkTikTok

unlinkTikTok() => Promise<void>

The unlinkTikTok method unlinks the user's TikTok account from the Auth Hub.

await auth.unlinkTikTok();

unlinkTelegram

unlinkTelegram() => Promise<void> The unlinkTelegram method unlinks the user's Telegram account from the Auth Hub.

await auth.unlinkTelegram();

React

The React components and hooks can be imported as ES6 modules. The example below shows how to set up the CampProvider component and subsequently use the provided hooks and components.

// main.jsx
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { CampProvider } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import App from "./App.jsx";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <CampProvider clientId="your-client-id">
        <App />
      </CampProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </StrictMode>
);

CampProvider

The CampProvider component requires a clientId prop to be passed in order link the users to your app. It can also take the following optional props:

    redirectUri - string | object - Either a string that will be used as the redirect URI for all socials, or an object with the following optional properties: twitter, discord, spotify. This is used to redirect the user to different pages after they have completed the OAuth flow for a social.

import { CampProvider } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";
// ...
function App() {
  return (
    <CampProvider
      clientId="your-client-id"
      redirectUri="https://your-website.com"
    >
      <div>Your app</div>
    </CampProvider>
  );
}

Or, with an object for the redirectUri:

import { CampProvider } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";
// ...
function App() {
  return (
    <CampProvider
      clientId="your-client-id"

  );
}

The CampProvider component sets up the context for the Origin SDK and provides the Auth instance to the rest of the app.
CampModal

The CampModal is a one-line* solution for authenticating users with the Origin SDK. It can be used to connect users to the Auth Hub and link and unlink social accounts.

It works as follows:

The CampModal component displays a button with the text "Connect" that the user can click on in order to summon the modal. The modal shows a list of available providers that the user can select from. After a provider has been selected, the connect method is called on the Auth instance to authenticate the user.

If the user is already authenticated, the button will instead say "My Camp" and the modal will display the user's Camp profile information and allow them to link and unlink social accounts.

The CampModal can take the following props:

    wcProjectId - string - The WalletConnect project ID to use for authentication. Allows the users to authenticate via WalletConnect.

    injectButton - boolean - Whether to inject the button into the DOM or not. Defaults to true. If set to false, the button will not be rendered and the modal can be opened programmatically via the openModal function returned by the useModal hook.

    onlyWagmi - boolean - Whether to only show the provider that the user is currently authenticated with. Defaults to false.

    defaultProvider - { provider: EIP1193Provider, info: EIP6963ProviderInfo, exclusive: boolean } - Custom provider to set as the highlighted provider in the modal. If not set, the wagmi provider will be highlighted if it is available. The exclusive property can be set to true to only show this provider in the modal.

    allowAnalytics - boolean - Whether to allow analytics to be collected. Defaults to true.

Usage

Basic usage of the CampModal component:

import { CampModal } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CampModal />
    </div>
  );
}

With custom props:

import { CampModal } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CampModal
        wcProjectId="your-wc-project-id"
        defaultProvider={{
          provider: window.ethereum,
          info: { name: "MetaMask", icon: "https://..." },
          exclusive: false,
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

You can find more examples here.

Only show the provider that the user is currently authenticated with (if using wagmi):

import { CampModal } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CampModal onlyWagmi />
    </div>
  );
}

Users can be authenticated either via the Camp Modal as outlined above or programmatically by calling the connect method on the Auth instance.
Usage with third party providers (Privy, Appkit, Magic, etc.)

The Camp Modal can be used in conjunction with providers such as Privy and Appkit to create a seamless authentication experience for users. When using wagmi, it will automatically detect if the user is authenticated via a third party provider and give them the option to connect to the Auth Hub using that provider. Otherwise, you can set up the default provider to be whatever provider you are using.

Example usage with Privy

Example usage with Appkit

Example usage with magic.link

After the user has authenticated, you can use the provided hooks to fetch user data and listen for events.
LinkButton

The LinkButton component is a button that can be used to link and unlink social accounts. Under the hood it uses the useLinkModal hook to open the Link Socials modal.

The LinkButton can take the following props:

    social - string - The social account to link or unlink. Can be one of: twitter, discord, spotify.

    variant - string - The variant of the button. Can be one of: default, icon. Defaults to default.

    theme - string - The theme of the button. Can be one of: default, camp. Defaults to default.

Note: The <CampModal/> component must be rendered in the component tree for the buttons to work.
Usage

Basic usage of the LinkButton component:

import { LinkButton, CampModal } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CampModal />
      <LinkButton social="twitter" />
      <LinkButton social="discord" variant="icon" />
      <LinkButton social="spotify" theme="camp" />
      <LinkButton social="tiktok" variant="icon" theme="camp" />
      <LinkButton social="telegram" />
    </div>
  );
}

Hooks

import { useAuth } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";

function App() {
  const auth = useAuth();

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={auth.connect}>Connect</button>
    </div>
  );
}

useAuthState

The useAuthState hook returns the current authentication state of the user.

import { useAuthState } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";

function App() {
  const { authenticated, loading } = useAuthState();

  return (
    <div>
      {loading && <div>Loading...</div>}
      {authenticated && <div>Authenticated</div>}

import { useProvider } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";

function App() {
  const { provider, setProvider } = useProvider();

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Current provider: {provider.info.name}</div>

function App() {
  const providers = useProviders();
  const { setProvider } = useProvider();

  return (
    <div>
      {providers.map((provider) => (
        <button key={provider.info.name} onClick={() => setProvider(provider)}>
          {provider.info.name}
        </button>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

The useConnect hook returns functions that can be used to connect and disconnect the user.

import { useConnect, useAuthState } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";

function App() {
  const { connect, disconnect } = useConnect();
  const { authenticated } = useAuthState();

  return (
    <div>
      {authenticated ? (
        <button onClick={disconnect}>Disconnect</button>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={connect}>Connect</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

useSocials

The useSocials hook returns the state of the user's linked social accounts.

import { useSocials } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";

function App() {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useSocials();

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (error) return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Twitter: {data.twitter ? "Linked" : "Not linked"}</div>

  } = useLinkSocials();

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={linkTwitter}>Link Twitter</button>
      <button onClick={linkDiscord}>Link Discord</button>
      <button onClick={linkSpotify}>Link Spotify</button>
      <button onClick={() => linkTiktok("tiktokhandle")}>Link TikTok</button>

      <button onClick={unlinkTelegram}>Unlink Telegram</button>
    </div>
  );
}

useModal

The useModal hook returns the state of the Auth and My Camp modals, as well as functions to show and hide them.

Note: The <CampModal/> component must be rendered in the component tree for the modals to be displayed.

import { useModal, CampModal } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";

function App() {
  const { isOpen, openModal, closeModal } = useModal();

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={openModal}>Open Modal</button>
      <button onClick={closeModal}>Close Modal</button>
      <CampModal injectButton={false} />
    </div>
  );
}

The state and functions returned by the useModal hook can be used to show and hide the Auth and My Camp modals, as well as to check if they are currently open. The modal being controlled is dictated by the user's authentication state.
useLinkModal

The useLinkModal hook returns the state of the Link Socials modal, as well as functions to show and hide it.

Note: The <CampModal/> component must be rendered in the component tree for the modal to be displayed.

import { useLinkModal, CampModal } from "@campnetwork/origin/react";

function App() {
  const { isLinkingOpen, openTwitterModal } = useLinkModal();

  return (
    <div>
      <CampModal />
      <button onClick={openTwitterModal}>Link Twitter</button>
    </div>
  );
}

It returns the following properties and functions:

    isLinkingOpen - boolean - Whether the Link Socials modal is open or not.

    openTwitterModal - () => void

    openDiscordModal - () => void

    openSpotifyModal - () => void

    openTiktokModal - () => void

    openTelegramModal - () => void

    linkTwitter - () => void

    linkDiscord - () => void

    linkSpotify - () => void

    linkTiktok - () => void

    linkTelegram - () => void

    unlinkTwitter - () => void

    unlinkDiscord - () => void

    unlinkSpotify - () => void

    unlinkTiktok - () => void

    unlinkTelegram - () => void

    closeModal - () => void

The difference between the openXModal functions and the linkX / unlinkX functions is that the former opens the modal regardless of the user's linking state, allowing them to either link or unlink their account, while the latter only opens the specified modal if the user's linking state allows for it.

For example, if the user is linked to Twitter, calling openTwitterModal will open the modal to unlink their Twitter account, while calling linkTwitter will not do anything, and calling unlinkTwitter will open the modal to unlink their Twitter account.

    Origin V1

‚öíÔ∏èOrigin Protocol

Onchain Data Marketplace ‚Äë-IP Registry

A trust-minimised marketplace where creators mint data feeds as NFTs and buyers purchase time-boxed subscriptions. The whole revenue split is enforced on-chain.

For preventing infringed/fraudulent ip content from being monetised, we have a dispute module in place where anyone can raise a dispute against a potentially infringed/fraudulent ip and depending on the resolution it would prevent further subscriptions from that ip.
High Level Architecture
Contracts Overview

IP NFT

    Serves as the central component of the system, representing tokenized intellectual property rights through the ERC721 token standard.

    Mints are done through EIP-712 verification.

    The mintWithSignature function accepts an array of parent id‚Äôs with a maximum of 8 parents, in case a derivative ip is to be minted and a call is made to the MarketPlace contract to verify the parent-derivative/child relationship and setting it in storage for royalty payments, dispute propagation etc.

    Handles delete functionality for the minted ip content and allows the DisputeModule to mark a ip as disputed based on the resolution.

MarketPlace

    Handles subscription purchases for Ip‚Äôs when the buyAccess function is called

    Handles royalty payments to the ip‚Äôs and its parent ip holders too in case of derivative ip‚Äôs.

    To prevent DOS attacks during royalty transfers, we have a royalty vault for each creator where the royalty is sent too and they can claim it accordingly.

    Handles treasury fee distribution too on every subscription purchase.

Dispute Module

    Allows anyone to raise a dispute against a potentially infringed/fraudulent IP and provides evidence and a fixed dispute bond in $wCAMP by calling the raiseDispute function.

    The ip against which the dispute was raised, its owner can assert that dispute providing counter evidence within a fixed dispute cooldown period by calling the disputeAssertion function.

    Once the dispute cooldown for a specific dispute is over, the camp dao committee can judge the dispute off-chain and resolve it on-chain by calling setDisputeJudgement function.

    Within the dispute cooldown period as long as it has not been asserted the dispute initiator can cancel it by calling cancelDispute function.

    Anyone can also call the tagChildIp function to raise a dispute against a derivative ip whose parent has already been disputed.

Royalty Vault

    It is deployed for each creator on each mint

    It is used to send royalties for all type of ip's

    The creator to which the vault belongs can call the claimRoyalty function to claim royalties.

‚úîÔ∏èVerifying Your Smart Contracts

In here we demonstrate on how you can verify smart contracts in blockscout

Verifying a smart contract involves confirming that the code deployed on the blockchain matches the source code provided by the developer. This verification process ensures transparency and trust, as it allows all users to see the source code in clear text. By making the source code publicly accessible, users can independently verify the contract‚Äôs functionality and security, fostering greater confidence in the decentralized application‚Äôs integrity.
Using Forge Foundry

forge verify-contract <contract address> src/SomeContract.sol:SomeContract --verifier blockscout --verifier-url https://basecamp.cloud.blockscout.com/api

Using Remix

Using the verify tab fill details similar to the one below

After verifying you should see that your smart contract has the green checkmark
